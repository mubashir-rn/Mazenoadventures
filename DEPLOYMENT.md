# SPA Routing Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Problem Solved
Fixed the 404 error that occurred when trying to access pages directly via URL (like `/expeditions`, `/about-us`, etc.) on Vercel deployment.

## Root Cause
The issue was that your React app uses client-side routing with `BrowserRouter`, but Vercel didn't know how to handle direct access to these routes. When someone visits `/expeditions` directly, Vercel looked for a file at that path instead of serving your React app.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `vercel.json` Configuration
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/sitemap.xml",
      "dest": "/sitemap.xml"
    },
    {
      "src": "/robots.txt", 
      "dest": "/robots.txt"
    },
    {
      "src": "/assets/(.*)",
      "dest": "/assets/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration tells Vercel:
- Serve static files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt) directly
- Serve assets from the assets directory
- **Fallback all other routes to index.html** (this is the key fix)

### 2. Added `public/_redirects` Fallback
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

This serves as a backup redirect rule that ensures all routes are handled by your React app.

## How It Works

1. **Client-side navigation**: Works as before - React Router handles navigation
2. **Direct URL access**: Vercel now serves `index.html` for any route, letting React Router take over
3. **Static files**: Properly served from their original locations
4. **SEO files**: `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` are served correctly

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix SPA routing for Vercel deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - If you have Vercel CLI: `vercel --prod`
   - Or push to your connected Git repository and Vercel will auto-deploy

3. **Test the fix:**
   - Visit your deployed site
   - Navigate to any page (like `/expeditions`)
   - Copy the URL and open it in a new tab
   - It should now work without 404 errors!

## Routes That Are Now Fixed

All these routes will work when accessed directly:
- `/expeditions`
- `/expedition/:id`
- `/trekkings` 
- `/trek/:id`
- `/holiday-tours`
- `/destinations`
- `/resources`
- `/about-us`
- `/contact-us`

## Testing Locally

The preview server is now running at http://localhost:4173. You can test:
1. Navigate to different pages using the menu
2. Copy any page URL and open it in a new tab
3. All routes should work correctly

## Additional Notes

- The `vercel.json` file is the primary solution
- The `_redirects` file provides additional compatibility
- Your existing React Router setup remains unchanged
- SEO and static files are preserved and served correctly

## Future Maintenance

- Keep the `vercel.json` file in your repository
- If you add new routes to your React app, they'll automatically be handled
- No additional configuration needed for new pages
